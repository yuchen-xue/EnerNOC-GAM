# EnerNOC-GAM

This is the final assignment of the course “Regression Analysis” at National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST). The purpose of this final assignment is to test the students' knowledge of the R language and their ability to analyze a dataset using a linear model.

In this assignment, I selected a modified version of the open source dataset published by the energy supply company EnerNOC, which contains the 30-minute energy consumption data for 100 commercial/industrial sites for the year 2012. I split the data into training and testing subset, built several linear models using Generalized Additive Model (GAM) with different conditions using the training set, predicted the energy consumption and examined the prediction result using the test data. The model could successfully generalize the change in energy consumption and achieved a MAPE value of 14.89.
